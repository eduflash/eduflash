### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I recently retired from special needs teaching and I am currently exploring a new role. I trained as a
counsellor and life coach and have experience of working with a variety of age groups in this field and
I am interested in developing educational and mental health resources,which include exploring using Unity to create interatcive VR environments. In the past I has created interative phonics games using Adobe flash and action script. I'm now learning HTML, pyython and javascrpt.
